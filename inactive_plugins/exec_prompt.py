"""Execute a prompt by the bot which has been approved by a user.

Some command plugins do not immediately execute the requested action
but instead build the actual command which would have been executed
and asks the user whether they want to execute it like that. The
user can then react with a (configurable) approve emoji.
This plugin will catch the reaction event and execute the command in
the message the user has reacted to.
In order to prevent misuse, the reacting user has to have the same
user id as the original requesting user.

Request messages crafted by the bot look like this:
```
Hi XXX!
Your input would lead to the execution of the following command.
Do you want to execute this? If yes, please react with :check: to this message.
original_message_id: XXX
command: XXX
```
